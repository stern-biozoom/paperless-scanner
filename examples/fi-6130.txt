Usage: scanimage [OPTION]...

Start image acquisition on a scanner device and write image data to
standard output.

Parameters are separated by a blank from single-character options (e.g.
-d epson) and by a "=" from multi-character options (e.g. --device-name=epson).
-d, --device-name=DEVICE   use a given scanner device (e.g. hp:/dev/scanner)
    --format=pnm|tiff|png|jpeg|pdf  file format of output file
-i, --icc-profile=PROFILE  include this ICC profile into TIFF file
-L, --list-devices         show available scanner devices
-f, --formatted-device-list=FORMAT similar to -L, but the FORMAT of the output
                           can be specified: %d (device name), %v (vendor),
                           %m (model), %t (type), %i (index number), and
                           %n (newline)
-b, --batch[=FORMAT]       working in batch mode, FORMAT is `out%d.pnm' `out%d.tif'
                           `out%d.png' or `out%d.jpg' by default depending on --format
                           This option is incompatible with --output-file.    --batch-start=#        page number to start naming files with
    --batch-count=#        how many pages to scan in batch mode
    --batch-increment=#    increase page number in filename by #
    --batch-double         increment page number by two, same as
                           --batch-increment=2
    --batch-print          print image filenames to stdout
    --batch-prompt         ask for pressing a key before scanning a page
    --accept-md5-only      only accept authorization requests using md5
-p, --progress             print progress messages
-o, --output-file=PATH     save output to the given file instead of stdout.
                           This option is incompatible with --batch.
-n, --dont-scan            only set options, don't actually scan
-T, --test                 test backend thoroughly
-A, --all-options          list all available backend options
-h, --help                 display this help message and exit
-v, --verbose              give even more status messages
-B, --buffer-size=#        change input buffer size (in kB, default 32)
-V, --version              print version information
Output format is not set, using pnm as a default.

    --overscan Default|Off|On [Default] [advanced]

        off. Will be rounded to nearest 15 minutes. Zero means never power off.
    --lowmemory[=(yes|no)] [no] [advanced]
        Limit driver memory usage for use in embedded systems. Causes some
        duplex transfers to alternate sides on each call to sane_read. Value of
